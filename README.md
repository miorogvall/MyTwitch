# MyTwitch
A Chrome extension that lets you follow live streams from twitch.tv

Version: 0.5
MyTwitch is a browser extension for Google Chrome that sends you notificiations when your favourite streamers go online.

MyTwitch is developed, designed and maintained by Mio Rogvall and is in alpha.

When the extension has been installed it will place a small Twitch icon on the top right of the browser window. The first thing you should do is to set your Twitch account name. To do this, click on the cog-wheel that is in the top right INSIDE the extension popup. Enter your username and click save. The extension will then fetch live streams for you, sometimes the change will take a minute to go through, but after that you should be good! Never miss a live stream again.
